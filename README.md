# ZOT Pantry

## Inspiration
In the hustle of daily life, it's easy to forget about the perishable food items we store away. ZOT Pantry was inspired by the common dilemma of food waste. Our goal is to help individuals manage their pantry more effectively, reminding them of what's about to expire and suggesting creative ways to use their ingredients before they go to waste.

## What ZOT Pantry Does
ZOT Pantry is a user-friendly web application that allows users to log their food items and track their expiration dates. Items nearing expiration are flagged as "expiring soon," while those past their dates are marked as "expired." To minimize waste, ZOT Pantry also suggests recipes based on the ingredients you have at hand, ensuring that nothing goes to waste.

## How We Built It
- **Front-end**: Developed with `React`, `JavaScript`, and `CSS`, providing an engaging user experience.
- **Design**: UI mock-ups crafted using `Figma`, ensuring a polished and intuitive interface.
- **Back-end**: Utilized `JavaScript` and the `Spoonacular API` for backend processes, especially for fetching personalized recipe suggestions.

## Challenges We Ran Into
As beginners, we faced a steep learning curve, especially with `React`. Time management and ensuring that our project's scope was feasible within the given timeframe were significant concerns. Integrating the front-end with the back-end to work seamlessly was another hurdle we successfully overcame.

## Accomplishments We're Proud Of
Despite being newcomers to hackathons and having minimal prior knowledge, we delivered a functional project with a clear purpose and minimal bugs. Notably, our team member Aaron won a $25 Amazon gift card at a social event!

## What We Learned
This project was a crash course in `React`, `JavaScript`, `CSS`, and using APIs, along with practical use of `GitHub`. We learned about code versioning, merging, and the importance of team collaboration in software development.

## What's Next for ZOT Pantry
We are looking to expand ZOT Pantry's features to include:
- User account creation for personalized experiences.
- Dietary restriction filters for recipe recommendations.
